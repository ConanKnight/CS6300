# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 20

## 1 Introduction

We will be building a Simple Cryptogram game. Users will be able to select a cryptogram created by the game's administrators and attempt to decypher it. 
Players will be able to view how many cryptograms they've solved compared to other players via a centralized server. 

## 2 Process Description

*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*

- 	Inception
- 	In this phase, we will identify requirements and briefly touch on the timeline for construction of the product, including a product plan.
- 	For this activity, we will need the requirements document as presented by the stakeholders.
-	This activity will produce a UML class document, a use case model, and a general project plan. When all members of the team are in agreement, this activity has been completed.

- 	Elaboration
- 	In this phase, we will generate a test plan, and address more detailed functional and non-functional requirements. We will 
	ensure thorough understanding of the requirements and technical limitations of the system, address any requirement gaps, and develop a detailed system archetecture
	in preparation for the next phase. 
- 	For this activity, we will need the requirements document presented by the stakeholders as well as the class diagram which was a result of the previous phase. 
-	This activity will produce a test plan, a refined project plan, a unified archetectural document, a refined use case model, a wireframe of the application, 
	and a document detailing additional functional and non-functional requirements which may not have been covered in other documents or sections. 
	A thorough review of these documents to ensure stability, compliance with the original requirements document from the stakeholders, and signoff from all developers will be necessary to complete this phase.

-	Construction
-	In this phase, we will construct the application per requirements. We may also update requirements, use cases, test plans, and the project plan as our understanding develops. In general, no 
	document from previous phases is considered static, and should be consistently updated to reflect the way things are actually implemented, rather than serving as a contrast between the original 
	plan and the final outcome. We will also perform the explicit activity of tracing source code and test cases to requirements developed in the previous phases.
-	For this activity, aside from the obvious technical inputs (a functioning IDE) we will need the inputs from the previous two phases, as well as access to the stakeholders to confirm
	design decisions we may need to make which impact core functionality.
-	The output of this phase is a working product and a set of working artifacts (specifically, an .apk) with some implemented test cases. A set of tests which pass, although which may not be	
	exhaustive, as well as a general smoke test of the product, will be necessary to pass this phase.

-	Transition
-	In this phase, we will polish our application, test cases, and documentation so that they are ready to be deployed and maintained. 
-	For this activity, we will need previous artifacts, as well as a review from the product owner to identify areas which need polish.
-	This activity will output a final working artifact and all previous design documents, possibly altered, updated, or polished. It will also produce a set of test cases (unit, integration, regression) for use
	by future teams performing maintanance. It will be considered complete when all test cases pass, and final signoff is given.
	
## 3 Team

*Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)*

-	Team members:
	Rohan Shroff, Nick Marsh, Anton Ryabchikov, Justin Allen. 

-	Roles:	
	Developer: Performs development activities, requirements analysis
	QA: Performs test case analysis and implementation.
	PM: Maintains schedule and facilitates communication between dev/QA and the business/stakeholders
	Product Owner: Performs final signoff on the product, serves as in-house stakeholder on behalf of the customer
	Architect: Owns the overall architecture of the project, selects technologies to be used in each phase. 
	Note that due to the small size of the teams and the limited time constraints, all roles will be required to actually code and implement unit tests. Roles in this case indicate ownership of the outcome. 
	So, PO owns the final signoff on requirements coverage, QA owns final signoff on test coverage, etc.
