Pros:
It seems like we all agree on the User/Player/Administrator relationship, and the presence of a Solution class, and generally how it relates to Cryptograms and players.
It's worth exploring if the edit/save methods really belong on the contract of the Cryptogram.

Cons:
Do you think the FN/LN belongs on the User object, or on the Player object? Does an administrator also need a username? Do they both need a password?
Why is the administrator aware of only one cryptogram? 
Why is a solution aware of the number of cryptograms solved/started?
Is Solution potentially an aggregation class?
